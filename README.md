# Random Chat

Random-chat room was created to mimic a conventional chat room, websocket ratchet was used along with MySQL to save and delete users. As soon as you enter the chat, a new user is created in Mysql containing the connection id and username, as soon as you leave the server, the connection is closed and your username no longer exists in the database. Data appears on the user interface such as a notification when someone new connects, when a user is disconnected and messages with the username and time of the message.

Developed with PHP, jQuery and WebSocket Ratchet.
